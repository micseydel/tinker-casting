This is a getting-started vault for [tinker-casting](https://github.com/micseydel/tinker-casting). It is intended to be viewed with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) although Obsidian isn't FOSS and isn't strictly required. If you're on modern Mac then following the instructions should be sufficient to get things working, but getting things working on Windows would require programming or at least comfortable computer knowledge.

# Getting Started (on Mac)

- Install Home Brew if you haven't already - [brew.sh](https://brew.sh)
- Install sbt
	- `brew install sbt`
- Open a terminal in `tinker-casting`
- Run `sbt compile`
- If it doesn't work, you probably need the right Java version
	- Install [sdkman](https://sdkman.io/) (once)
		- (If you already have a system in place for managing multiple Java versions, you can consider using that instead of installing SDK man)
	- `sdk install java 17.0.0-tem` (once)
	- `source ~/.sdkman/bin/sdkman-init.sh`
		- You may see **java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: Could not initialize class sbt.internal.parser.SbtParser$** or similar in the future (e.g. [[What happens with Java versions beyond 17]]) then run the "source" command again
- Configure the environment
	- `cp tinkerenv.bash.template tinkerenv.bash`
	- Now edit `tinkerenv.bash` so that `vaultRoot` specifies **your** computer's path
- Run:
	- `./tinkerenv.bash`

## Setup: Voice transcription

- `brew install ffmpeg`
- `cd scripts/whisper_wrapper` (within tinker-casting)
- `python3.10 -m venv py3.10_venv`
	- Python 3.10 is needed (note: ==the specific dependencies need better documentation==)
- (==May need to use Bash, not zsh, from here==)
	- (zsh may work, actually, but I'm not sure about fish shell)
- `source py3.10_venv/bin/activate` ==every new terminal session== ^cd6662
- `pip install --upgrade pip`
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`
	- (this may take some time to download things)
	- If it fails, try running it again
- Now let's confirm the install by downloading and running the transcription model, before getting the whole system up and going...
	- Do ***not*** "Click to create" below, Obsidian should detect the file being created and update automatically when the above command is used
	- Make a recording targeting this vault's `playground` folder, e.g.
		- `python tinker_demo.py ~/Tinker\ Casting\ Starter\ Kit/Tinker\ Casting\ Starter\ Vault/playground/`
		- The first time (only!), this will download the large model, which is ~3GB
		- Try to keep this window open while the transcription is happening; even after the download, a short transcription will still take a moment and you can run the command above repeatedly to see the list added to
	- ![[Playground]]
- Consider installing the IntelliJ Python Community Edition plugin if you're working much with the Python code itself

## Setup: machine-learning for voice transcription

- ==TODO: VERIFY==
- [[#^cd6662|Within the venv]], navigate to `scripts` and train the model
	- `cd scripts`
	- [ ] `rasa train`
- For training data, see `nlu.yml`
- POTENTIALLY NEEDED
	- `brew install librdkafka`  ([ref](https://github.com/confluentinc/confluent-kafka-python/issues/995))

## Setup: Hue smart lights

- TODO

## Setup: Chime sounds

- TODO

## Setup: Ntfy mobile push notifications

- TODO


## Viewing the source

- **Notes:**
	- non-coders can return to this section later
	- if you skipped compilation above, IntelliJ will not work as well until an sbt compilation completes
- Setup [IntelliJ community edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/?section=mac) (for example via [Jetbrains Toolbox](https://www.jetbrains.com/toolbox-app/))
	- Open `tinker-casting`
	- ("Trust Project" is [recommended](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/2024.2/project-security.html?Project_security))
	- Open TinkerCasterApp.scala
	- Install Scala Plugin
		- I was prompted, but: Cmd+, for settings, search "plugins"
	- Setup Scala SDK (as prompted)
		- ![[Pasted image 20241123171341.png]]
		- Download 2.12.20
	- File > Project structure (or Cmd+;)
		- Set Java SDK to version 17
			- ![[Pasted image 20240922144608.png]]
			- *My first go-through, it was in "Detected SDKs"*
	- Load sbt Project
		- It's the hexagon near the top right of the window
		- ![[Pasted image 20241123172015.png]]
		- ![[Pasted image 20241123172022.png|240]]
		- Once expanded, use the button to the left of the plus (+) symbol to *Sync All sbt Projects*
		- ![[Pasted image 20241123172045.png|480]]
- PyCharm is better for the Python code, but the Python code gets fewer updates so ðŸ¤·

# Python setup

- `brew install ffmpeg`
- `cd scripts` (this is generally for everything in the Python section)
- `python3.10 -m venv py3.10_venv`
	- Python 3.10 is needed (note: ==the specific dependencies need better documentation==)
- (==May need to use Bash, not zsh, from here==)
	- (zsh may work, actually, but I'm not sure about fish shell)
- `source py3.10_venv/bin/activate` ==every new terminal session== ^cd6662
- `pip install --upgrade pip`
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`
	- (this may take some time to download things)
	- If it fails, try running it again
- Now let's confirm the install by downloading and running the transcription model, before getting the whole system up and going...
	- Do ***not*** "Click to create" below, Obsidian should detect the file being created and update automatically when the above command is used
	- Make a recording targeting this vault's `playground` folder, e.g.
		- `python tinker_demo.py ~/Tinker\ Casting\ Starter\ Kit/Tinker\ Casting\ Starter\ Vault/playground/`
		- The first time (only!), this will download the large model, which is ~3GB

# ==Tinker Cast Deployment==

- Environment variables; in the repository root, not in scripts/
	- `cp tinkerenv.bash.template tinkerenv.bash`
	- Open tinkerenv.bash and modify it as-needed per the inline comments, e.g.
		- vaultRoot `/Users/tinkercaster/Tinker Casting Starter Kit/Tinker Casting Starter Vault`
		- audioWatchPath `/Users/tinkercaster/Tinker Casting Starter Kit/Tinker Casting Starter Vault/attachments/mobile_audio_captures`
		- Other things can probably be left as-is
	- `chmod +x tinkerenv.bash`
- In 3 separate terminals
	- `caffeinate ./tinkerenv.bash`
	- Within `scripts`, ensuring the venv is activated in both,
		- Start the transcription and Rasa server
			- `python transcriber.py large 5001 ~/Tinker\ Casting\ Starter\ Kit/Tinker\ Casting\ Starter\ Vault/`
			- There's a lot of output, if everything goes ok you can ignore anything before this:
				- ![[Pasted image 20241128135148.png]]
				- (your model name will vary)
		- Test by using the same capture script as earlier,
			- `python rec_unlimited_play.py ~/Tinker\ Casting\ Starter\ Kit/Tinker\ Casting\ Starter\ Vault/attachments/mobile_audio_captures/`
			- Look at the Python server output to see the transcription status
				- (Expect transcription time to be ~50-100% of the recording time)
			- Once the callback completes, check [[Transcribed mobile notes (2024-MM-DD)]], e.g. [[Transcribed mobile notes (2024-09-26)]] (Cmd+mouse over the note with the date corrected, it shouldn't take more than a moment to appear)
		- [ ] ==[[Recommended Tinkering]]== (open this note in a new tab and then come back)
- Logging
	- logs/???.log *examples*
		- application (*everything*)
		- error-warn
		- notifications
		- halto
		- foodreminder
		- cats
		- rememberingtimekeeper
	- Note - debug contains A LOT more info
	- [[Errors and warning considered normal for this demo]] (non-exhaustive)


# Tinkerbrain visualization (optional)

- Install npm if needed
	- `brew install npm`
- Navigate to `tinkerbrain`
	- `cd source_code/tinkerplot/tinkerbrain`
- `npm install`
- `npm run dev` (every time)

# After a full shutdown/restart

- Make sure to `source py3.10_venv/bin/activate` ==[[#^cd6662|every time]]==
- Selecting the JDK may be required - [[What happens with Java versions beyond 17]]
