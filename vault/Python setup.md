# Python setup

- `brew install ffmpeg`
- `cd scripts` (this is generally for everything in the Python section)
- `python3.10 -m venv py3.10_venv`
	- Python 3.10 is needed (note: ==the specific dependencies need better documentation==)
- (==May need to use Bash, not zsh, from here==)
	- (zsh may work, actually, but I'm not sure about fish shell)
- `source py3.10_venv/bin/activate` ==every new terminal session== ^cd6662
- `pip install --upgrade pip`
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`
	- (this may take some time to download things)
	- If it fails, try running it again
- Now let's confirm the install by downloading and running the transcription model, before getting the whole system up and going...
	- Do ***not*** "Click to create" below, Obsidian should detect the file being created and update automatically when the above command is used
	- Make a recording targeting this vault's `playground` folder, e.g.
		- `python tinker_demo.py ~/Tinker\ Casting\ Starter\ Kit/Tinker\ Casting\ Starter\ Vault/playground/`
		- The first time (only!), this will download the large model, which is ~3GB
		- Try to keep this window open while the transcription is happening; even after the download, a short transcription will still take a moment and you can run the command above repeatedly to see the list added to
	- ![[Playground]]
- Consider installing the IntelliJ Python Community Edition plugin if you're working much with the Python code itself
