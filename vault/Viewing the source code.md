- **Notes:**
	- non-coders can return to this section later
	- if you skipped compilation above, IntelliJ will not work as well until an sbt compilation completes
- Setup [IntelliJ community edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/?section=mac) (for example via [Jetbrains Toolbox](https://www.jetbrains.com/toolbox-app/))
	- Open `tinker-casting`
	- ("Trust Project" is [recommended](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/2024.2/project-security.html?Project_security))
	- Open TinkerCasterApp.scala
	- Install Scala Plugin
		- I was prompted, but: Cmd+, for settings, search "plugins"
	- Setup Scala SDK (as prompted)
		- ![[Pasted image 20241123171341.png]]

		- ![[Pasted image 20241123172022.png|240]]
		- Once expanded, use the button to the left of the plus (+) symbol to *Sync All sbt Projects*

- PyCharm is better for the Python code, but the Python code gets fewer updates so ðŸ¤·
