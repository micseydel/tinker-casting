- Initial motivation: so people wouldn't have to care so much about Whisper
- Whisper cannot be dockerized, at least on macOS, last I checked
- Lots of non-network I/O - file *watching*, sound I/O, Bluetooth
- It's not something I'm familiar with - could start with Wyze, and maybe Rasa, but it seems like it would add more than encapsulate complexity at this point
- (if I'm *wrong* about something, feel free to say so with a citation)
