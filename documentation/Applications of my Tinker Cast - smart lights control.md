After adding initial voice integration, it seemed natural to try to replace Alexa, starting with smart light controls. Much like the cat voice stuff, I added, "set the lights to relaxed" and "set the lights to 50%" and similar **voice commands**.

Here is a short demo of how I **control the lights with a note** as well. Each time the system detects a valid update to the note, it follows the command and then resets the file.

In the [notification center](Applications%20of%20my%20Tinker%20Cast%20-%20notification%20center.md), I integrate this application with [cat litter tracking](Applications%20of%20my%20Tinker%20Cast%20-%20cat%20litter%20tracking.md).
