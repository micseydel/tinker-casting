As further expansion on [[Applications of my Tinker Cast - cat litter tracking|cat litter tracking]], I built a text-based **notification center**. It's still quite rudimentary but daily-use events include:
- Reminding me to sift the litter, once it clumps
- Voice notes where I've said, "remind me"
- My daily plans, pulled from a [[Plans]] note

Here we see the latter two, where my notification center (along with current projects) is a pane on the left side of my Obsidian setup:

The first example in the list is less straightforward, but I think a short video will help:

So this goes fast, but here's what's going on:
- Offscreen, I make a voice note, "Butter just used the front litter box."
- A notification is registered with the upcoming notification center
- After 15 minutes a ripple indicates time passing (for the litter to clump)
    - the notification moves from the upcoming notification center to the notification center
    - my smart lights do a light show
- I mark the "remind me" for making the video as done and it's automatically cleared

When I make a note that I sifted the front litter box, the notification center entry is cleared automatically. As a happy accident, when it *isn't cleared* automatically, I know that means I need to manually integrate that litter sifting into the report for that application.
