I expand upon my single-stream [voice transcriptions](Applications%20of%20my%20Tinker%20Cast%20-%20voice%20transcriptions.md) for my **cat litter tracking**. A separate stream for my cats is created automatically:

Again, we see some voice notes are handled automatically but some are not - today's error rate is unusually high. The litter sifting report summary only includes 2/3 of the events it should:

The fix at this time is manual, and here's what the notes look like after that:

Whisper large v3 seems to have a higher error rate and I should probably drop back to v2, but it works well enough that I've focused on other things.

Later, when I take another voice note, the system will pick up where I left off - it will append a new event and update the summary.

To see how this is integrated with my **[smart lights](Applications%20of%20my%20Tinker%20Cast%20-%20smart%20lights%20control.md), see: [notification center](Applications%20of%20my%20Tinker%20Cast%20-%20notification%20center.md)**.
