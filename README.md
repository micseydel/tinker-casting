This is a "learning in public" personal code base. Instructions for getting started are at https://github.com/micseydel/tinker-starter-vault/

This is not polished and I tried to embrace my imperfectionism and -- at times -- a little bit of chaos. There's no style guide, I've been tinkering informally. There are lots of bugs and improvements to be made, both in style, code architecture, and potentially Pekko or Scala 3.
